### Bike rental at train stations
Are you coming by public transport and would you like to follow the races by bike? Or if you are using the Park and Ride towards the city centre?

You can rent a bike at the nearby train stations Amsterdam Amstel and Amsterdam Zuid.

Keep in mind that you will need to pay for a deposit and need a proof of identification. Some locations will accept reservation, others won't due to the high demand during the event weekends.
