### Bike rental at Willem III
Do you want to cycle along the Amstel to follow the races? It is possible to rent bikes at rowing club Willem III. However, there is only a limited number of bikes available and making a reservation is not possible.

Please check the Info desk at Willem III for availability.

#### Prices:
- € 10 per time slot
- € 15 per 2 time slots

You can pay via a digital payment request (QR-code). We also require a deposit for the bikes. For this, we ask for a OV-chip card, ID or driver's license, or bank card.

### Bike rental at train stations
Are you coming by public transport and would you like to follow the races by bike? Or if you are using the Park and Ride towards the city centre?

You can rent a bike at the nearby train stations Amsterdam Amstel and Amsterdam Zuid.

Keep in mind that you will need to pay for a deposit and need a proof of identification. Some locations will accept reservation, others won't due to the high demand during the event weekends.
