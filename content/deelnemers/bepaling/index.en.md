#### Combining of events:
Events in which 3 or fewer teams were registered at the time of closing of the registration will be merged with a higher event. Events for seniors will first be merged with a higher event based on performance points and then based on weight category. In the case of Masters, the event will be merged with a event with a younger average crew age. If there are no more events to merge an event with insufficient registrations, the event will not be rowed.

#### Coxswain Meeting:

A coxswain meeting will not take place this year. Instructions for crews and their coxswains are available online on the Coxswains site.
All coxswains must be familiar with the instructions.   
With the exception of coxswains in the junior 16 events, a cox of any crew has to be at least 15 years in the year of the race.

#### Placement:

Last year’s finish time determines the starting order. For Masters teams, a team must “match” with a team from last year (50% same rowers or more). Only the fastest 50% of the matched teams will be placed. Starting positions of all other Master’s teams will be drawn by lottery after the seeded crews. For the remaining events (as before) the club results from last year applies. If more teams per rowing club are entered in the same event, the club’s team numbering will be used for placement.

#### Pennants:

Pennants will be awarded to the fastest Dutch club eight in the elite men and women events. In case the elite event is not held, or the is no club eight in the event, the pennant is awarded to the best performing club eight in the next highest event based on performance points.

#### Boat trailers:

Boat trailers need to be registered in advance at the organizing committee. Check for more information our [boat trailer page](../botenwagens/).

## Rules

RULES FOR RACING LONG DISTANCE CHAMPIONSHIP RACE: THE HEAD OF THE RIVER AMSTEL 2025

1. **GENERAL**   

    The race will be held in eights and coxed fours for men and women who are members of a KNRB-affiliated rowing club or with another member of FISA. The race will be held under the rules and regulations of the KNRB with the exceptions and special provisions below. Events for freshmen and “gevorderde” rowers are not open to foreign teams.

    The fastest Dutch club team of the Elite eights in the men’s and women’s competition win the Championship of the Amstel. To symbolize this championship, this club may fly a long blue pennant from the club’s flagpole throughout the year.   

    Participation in the competition shall be at one’s own risk. The liability of the organizing clubs ARB and Willem III (including their organizers, i.e. the Head Committee and the Head volunteers working with the committee) for any damage resulting from or related to participation in the competition, is, except in the case of intentional act or omission, recklessness or gross negligence, always limited to the amount which the applicable insurance policy gives entitlement to, increased by the amount of the deductible under the relevant policy.   

    Except in the case of intent or gross recklessness on the part of the Organization, the participant shall indemnify and hold harmless the Organization in respect of all claims which any third party may at any time bring against the Organization and which are connected with acts or omissions of the participant during his or her participation in the event.

2. **TIMING**
   
    The races are organized as time trials. The time in which each crew completes the course shall be recorded. The team with the fastest time is the winner. Under no circumstances will a team be allowed to row the race a second time.   
    Teams with a measured time difference less then 0.20 seconds are considered to be equal in time.

3. **CREW CHANGES**
   
    Any changes in the team composition can be reported to the race committee in accordance with article RRS 40.

    - At any time after the draw and on race days, changes shall be made via the KNRB registration system.
    - On race days, changes can also be reported in writing at the desk.   

    If the change results in the team no longer being eligible to start in the field in which they are registered, the change will be refused. A change will never result in a change of the field in which the team starts.

4. **STARTING ORDER**

    Except for masters teams, the starting order is determined by last year’s results in a division. The winning team from last year starts first. The team from the club that had finished 2nd starts 2nd, etc. Combination teams and new entries are assigned by drawing lots after the last placed association team. If more teams are entered per club in the same event, the club’s team numbering will be used for placement. So, team with number 1 gets the best placed team from the previous year.

    For masters, the starting order is determined in 2 steps. First, it is determined whether a team matches a team from last year. A team is matched if at least half of the rowers match a team from last year. Next, from all matched teams, only the fastest 50% are placed (again based on last year’s result). The other 50% and all unmatched teams are unplaced. Their starting position falls behind the seeded teams and is determined by drawing lots.

5. **RACE NUMBERS**
   
    Race numbers must be clearly visible on the backs of the coxswain and the bow rower during the race and when rowing up and down the river. One on the row rower race shirt, one on the bow rowers racing uniform and one on the coxwain sitting at the back (if the coxswain is in the front, then on the back deck).

    The bow number must be placed in the designated location on the bow of the boat, clearly visible.

    The three numbers and the bow number can only be picked up by a club representative after timely payment of the entry fee by the club (or foreign team) during the following times

    - Friday afternoon between 14.00 and 20.00 hrs.
    - Saturday between 09.00 and 15.00 hrs.
    - Sunday between 08.30 and 12.00 hrs.

    They can be picked up at rowing club Willem III.   

    All shirt numbers and bow numbers will be provided per registering club.   

    The shirt numbers do not have to be returned and can be taken home as souvenir.   

    The bow numbers must be returned to Willem III no later than the last day of the competition. If a bow number is not returned, the costs will be charged to the club. The cost is 10 euros per bow number.   

6. **COXSWAIN INSTRUCTIONS**
   
    There is no coxswain meeting this year. The instructions for crews and their coxswains can be found online on the [coxswain page](../stuurliedeninstructie/).

7. **WEIGHING**
   
    The weighing of the lightweight crews is on Sunday between 3 and 2 hours before the first start of their OWN race number (i.e. not of their own block) and also takes place at Skøll boathouse, Jan Vroegopsingel 6.   

    Coxwains do not have to weigh for any division.


8. **SAILING RESTRICTIONS**
   
    During certain periods in the weekend there will be a total ban on sailing on the river Amstel between Amsterdam and Ouderkerk except for crews participating in the races. The times of the ban are:

    - Saturday from 12:30 until 17:45 hrs.
    - Sunday from 9:30 until 15:45 hrs.

    Between one hour before the first start of a block and 10 minutes before the first start of a block, the race course south of the Rozenoordbrug (Rozenoord Bridge) may be used by crews entering that block in a southerly direction, provided that their allocated transit time of the Rozenoordbrug lies within that time period.

9.  **INSTRUCTIONS**
    
    Instructions of the race manager or any other race officials must be followed immediately. Any failure to follow these directions that results in the disruption in the proper running of the course and race, may result in a penalty for any organization or team involved.

10. **WARM-UP AND COOL-DOWN**
    
    Rowing up and rowing back take place in the row/return lane. This is located on the Willem III side (east side) of the Amstel River and is indicated by orange and yellow buoys.

    In the warm-up or return rowing lane, passing/overtaking is allowed when yellow buoys are present. Passing/overtaking is prohibited when orange buoys are present. Overtaking in prohibited areas will result in a penalty. Obstructing teams, ignoring instructions from race officials and managers may also result in a penalty. Multiple infractions will result in multiple penalties.

    Rowing on to the start is allowed when a race is passing by.   

    All crews must keep as much port side as possible and be considerate of the crews that have already started.

    Teams may only take permitted bridge opening. Taking a prohibited bridge opening will result in disqualification.

    While warming up toward the start and after the finish of the race, here are the openings that are permitted and not permitted for use:

    - Toronto Brug [Toronto Bridge]: passage under the Toronto Bridge is not permitted.
    - Nieuwe Amstelbrug: (Nieuwe Amstel Bridge): only the second bridge opening from port side is permitted for use.
    - Berlagebrug [Berlage Bridge]: the two port side bridge openings are permitted for use
    - Utrechtsebrug [Utrecht Bridge]: only the port side bridge opening is permitted for use
    - Rozenoordbrug [Rozenoord Bridge]: only the port side bridge opening is permitted for use
    - Brug in Ouderkerk [Bridge in Ouderkerk]: Passage under the  bridge in Ouderkerk is not permitted.

11. **CROSSING THE RACE COURSE**
    
    Crews that must cross the race course coming from the boathouses of De Amstel and Nereus must do so under supervision of the umpire or marshal present at the time. Crossing the racecourse without the permission is not allowed. If ongoing races are disturbed by the failure to follow the Race Manager’s instructions, the team concerned may receive penalty.

12. **LINE UP**

    Your own start time is the start time of your own event, increased by 1 minute for every 4 teams that start before you in your own event. The finish times based on these times will be explicitly stated on a separate draw.   
    
    The first check point, T1, is located at the Duivendrechtsevaart. Teams starting north may pass this point between 55 and 45 minutes before their own starting time.   
    
    The second checkpoint, T2, is located just before the Rozenoordbrug (Rozenoord Bridge). Crews must pass this point between 35 and 30 minutes before their starting time. Arriving late at this bridge checkpoint to row on, can result in disqualification.   
    
    After passing this point, crews may only row in a southerly direction until they reach the turning area in Ouderkerk.


13. **RACE COURSE**
    
    The length of the course for all teams is approximately 8 kilometers. The start is at Ouderkerk, at Amsteldijk Noord 37. The finish is in Amsterdam at KARZV De Hoop.   

    For coastal teams and junior 16 teams, the course is approximately 5 kilometers. The start is in Amstelveen, at Amsteldijk Noord 127-134. The finish is in Amsterdam at KARZV De Hoop.
 
    Check the [coxwains page](../stuurliedeninstructie/) for the current course map and further details.

14. **PRESTART, START AND FINISH**
    
    The Starting Line is marked by two poles with a white flag. At approximately 100 meters before the Starting Line, the Pre-starting line is marked by two poles with a red flag.   

    The start is a ‘flying start’ with an interval of 15 seconds between the crews. Between divisions, there will be a start difference of at least 60 seconds.   

    The Finish Line is marked by two poles with a red flag.

15. **COURSE MARKINGS**

    During the race, the buoys that split the race lane from the travel / warmup lane, must be kept on starboard side.   

    As can be seen on the course maps, extra buoys have been placed at the Amstel Canal, before the Big Bend, and before the finish for safety reasons. These additional buoys must be kept on port side.    

    A crew that passes a buoy at the wrong side or a crew that leaves the travel lane, may receive a penalized.

16. **BRIDGES ALONG THE COURSE**

    Crews are only allowed to go under the bridges through permitted openings. Passing a bridge through a prohibited opening leads to disqualification.

    - Utrechtsebrug (Utrechtse Bridge): only the port and middle openings are permitted for use.  Use of the other openings is forbidden.
    - Berlagburg (Berlag Bridge): only the middle opening and the two openings at port side are permitted for use. Use of the other openings are forbidden.   
    
    If fewer bridge holes are available during the Head of the River, due to construction works, we will publish modified regulations.   

    Immediately after the finish, crews must continue under the Nieuwe Amstel Brug (Bridge) to the turn buoy.
