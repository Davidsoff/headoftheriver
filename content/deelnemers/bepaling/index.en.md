## Rules

RULES FOR RACING LONG DISTANCE CHAMPIONSHIP RACE: THE HEAD OF THE RIVER AMSTEL 2024

1. **GENERAL**
    The race will be held in eights and steered fours for men and women who are members of a KNRB-affiliated rowing club or with another member of FISA. The competitive race will be held under the rules and regulations of the KNRB with the exceptions and special provisions below. Events for first year and advanced teams are not open to foreign teams.

    The fastest Dutch club team of the Elite eights in the men's and women's competition win the Championship of the Amstel. To symbolize this championship, this club may fly a long blue pennant from the club’s flagpole throughout the year.

    Participation in the competition shall be at one's own risk. The liability of the organizing clubs ARB and Willem III (including their organizers, i.e. the Head Committee and the Head volunteers working with the committee) for any damage resulting from or related to participation in the competition, is, except in the case of intentional act or omission, recklessness or gross negligence, always limited to the amount which the applicable insurance policy gives entitlement to, increased by the amount of the deductible under the relevant policy.

    Except in the case of intent or gross recklessness on the part of the Organization, the participant shall indemnify and hold harmless the Organization in respect of all claims which any third party may at any time bring against the Organization and which are connected with acts or omissions of the participant during his or her participation in the event.

2. **TIMING**
   
    The races are organized as time trials. The time in which each crew completes the course shall be recorded. The team with the fastest time is the winner. Under no circumstances will a team be allowed to row the race a second time.

3. **CREW CHANGES**
   
    Any changes in the team composition can be reported to the race committee in accordance with article RRS 37.

    - At any time after the draw and on race days, changes shall be made via the KNRB registration system.
    - On race days, changes can also be reported in writing at the desk.

4. **STARTING ORDER**

    Except for veteran teams, the starting order is determined by last year's results in a division. The winning team from last year starts first. The team from the club that had finished 2nd starts 2nd, etc. Combination teams and new entries are assigned by drawing lots after the last placed association team. If more teams are entered per club in the same event, the club’s team numbering will be used for placement. So, team with number 1 gets the best placed team from the previous year.

    For veteran teams, the starting order is determined in 2 steps. First, it is determined whether a team matches a team from last year. A team is matched if at least half of the rowers match a team from last year. Next, from all matched teams, only the fastest 50% are placed (again based on last year's result). The other 50% and all unmatched teams are unplaced. Their starting position falls behind the seeded teams and is determined by drawing lots.

5. **SHIRT NUMBERS**
   
    Shirt numbers must be clearly visible on the backs of the coxswain/helmsman and the bowman during the race and when rowing up and down the river. One back number on the bowman's race shirt, one on the bowman's call shirt and one on the steerer sitting at the back (if the steer is at the front, then on the back deck).

    The three shirt numbers can only be picked up by a club representative after timely payment (before 7th March into the ARB account) of the entry fee by the club (or foreign team) during the following times

    - Friday afternoon between 14.00 and 20.00 hrs.
    - Saturday between 09.00 and 15.00 hrs.
    - Sunday between 08.30 and 12.00 hrs.

    They can be picked up at Willem III.

    All shirt numbers will be provided per registering club.

    The shirt numbers do not have to be returned and can be taken home as souvenir.

6. **COXSWAIN INSTRUCTIONS**
   
    There is no coxswain meeting this year. The instructions for crews and their coxswains can be found online on the [coxswain page](../stuurliedeninstructie/).

7. **WEIGHING**
   
    In accordance with Article 7, paragraph 3 of the RvR, helmsmen for Masters, Club, Mixed, Company and Juniors 16 teams will not be weighed.

    The weighing of coxswains of other teams (Elite, Advanced, Freshmen and Junior 18 divisions) will take place at the boathouse of Skøll Rowing Club both on Saturday and Sunday between 3 and 2 hours before the first start of their OWN race.

    The weighing of the LIGHT teams is on Sunday between 3 and 2 hours before the first start of their OWN race number (i.e. not of their own block) and also takes place at Skøll boathouse, Jan Vroegopsingel 6.

8. **SAILING RESTRICTIONS**
   
    During certain periods in the weekend there will be a total ban on sailing on the river Amstel between Amsterdam and Ouderkerk except for crews participating in the races. The times of the ban are:

    - Saturday from 12:30 until 17:45 hrs.
    - Sunday from 9:30 until 15:45 hrs.

    Between one hour before the first start of a block and 10 minutes before the first start of a block, the race course south of the Rozenoordbrug (Rozenoord Bridge) may be used by crews entering that block in a southerly direction, provided that their allocated transit time of the Rozenoordbrug lies within that time period.

9.  **INSTRUCTIONS**
    
    Instructions of the race manager or any other race officials must be followed immediately.  Any failure to follow these directions that results in the disruption in the proper running of the course and race, may result in a penalty for any organization or team involved.

10. **WARM-UP AND COOL-DOWN**
    
    Rowing up and rowing back take place in the row/return lane. This is located on the Willem III side (east side) of the Amstel River and is indicated by orange and yellow buoys.

    In the warm-up or return rowing lane, passing/overtaking is allowed when yellow buoys are present. Passing/overtaking is prohibited when orange buoys are present. Overtaking in prohibited areas will result in a penalty. Obstructing teams, ignoring instructions from race officials and managers may also result in a penalty. Multiple infractions will result in multiple penalties.

    Rowing on to the start is allowed when a race is passing by.

    All crews must keep as much port side as possible and be considerate of the crews that have already started.

    Teams may only take permitted bridge opening. Taking a prohibited bridge opening will result in disqualification.

    While warming up toward the start and after the finish of the race, here are the openings that are permitted and not permitted for use:

    - Toronto Brug [Toronto Bridge]: passage under the Toronto Bridge is not permitted.
    - Nieuwe Amstelbrug: (Nieuwe Amstel Bridge): only the second bridge opening from port side is permitted for use.

    Crews that must cross the race course coming from the boathouses of De Amstel and Nereus must do so under supervision of the Race Manager present at the time. Crossing the racecourse without the Race Manager’s permission is not allowed. If ongoing races are disturbed by the failure to follow the Race Manager’s instructions, the team concerned may receive penalty.

12. **LINE UP**

    Your own start time is the start time of your own event, increased by 1 minute for every 4 teams that start before you in your own event. The finish times based on these times will be explicitly stated on a separate draw.

    The first check point, T1, is located at the Duivendrechtsevaart. Teams starting north may pass this point between 55 and 45 minutes before their own starting time.

    The second checkpoint, T2, is located just before the Rozenoordbrug (Rozenoord Bridge). Crews must pass this point between 40 and 35 minutes before their starting time. Arriving late at this bridge checkpoint to row on, can result in disqualification.

    After passing this point, crews may only row in a southerly direction until they reach the turning area in Ouderkerk.

13. **RACE COURSE**
    
    The length of the course is approximately 8 kilometres for all crews.

    The start is in Ouderkerk, close to the Oostmeerweg. The finish is in Amsterdam, just before the Nieuwe Amstel Brug (Bridge).
