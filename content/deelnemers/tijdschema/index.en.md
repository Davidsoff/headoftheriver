UPDATE 02/03/2025:

LDE4* combined with DE4*    
DMG8+ combined with DMF8+   
DMB8+ combined with DMA8+   
DMG4* combined with DMF4*    
MJ8+ combined with MI8+   

Below you will find the block schedule for the Head of the River 2025. We have a lot of different events with different criteria. [Here](../tijdschema/documents/Veldkeuze%20Head%202025%20dd%20050202025.pdf) you can find an overview of the events with their corresponding criteria.
