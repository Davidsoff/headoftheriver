### Boat rental for Head of the River Amstel
If you are unable to bring your own boat to the Head of the River Amstel, we will try to arrange a boat rental for you. Rowing Club Willem 3, one of the organising clubs, will make boats available. The costs for renting a boat are € 270,- for an eight and € 165,- for a four/quadruple.

For more information about the possibilities, please email us at wedstrijdsecretariaat@headoftheriver.nl, stating the type of boat you would like to rent and the name and contact details of your contact person.
