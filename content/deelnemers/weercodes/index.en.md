The Head of the River uses weather codes. Starting from the Wednesday before the event, the current weather code will be displayed on the homepage.

There are 3 weather codes: Green, Yellow, or Red. These weather codes indicate the situation regarding the next upcoming block. See below for an explanation of the weather codes.

No later than one and a half hours before the start of each block, a decision will be made whether that block will proceed, be cancelled, or be postponed. From that moment on, only code Green or Red will be shown. This decision is therefore made at:

- for block 1: Saturday, 11:45
- for block 2: Saturday, 14:30
- for block 3: Sunday, 9:30
- for block 4: Sunday, 12:30

### Explanation of Codes:

The weather gives no reason to make any changes to the schedule.

Attention! The weather forecast may lead to cancellation of the upcoming block or an adjustment of the timetable. Keep an eye on the website and the boathouse flags.

The weather conditions pose an unacceptable safety risk for the upcoming block. This block is cancelled until further notice. Keep an eye on the website for more information.
