📣 **Attention rowing teams and boat transporters**   
Have you registered your team for The Head of the River Amstel and are you coming with a boat trailer or are you transporting multiple teams/clubs?   

Don't forget to register your boat trailer on time and according to the official guidelines.     

For all rowing races along the Amstel, registration of boat trailers is mandatory. Without registration, access to the racecourse may be denied.
