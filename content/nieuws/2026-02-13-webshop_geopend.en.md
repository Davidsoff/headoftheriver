The Head of the River now has its own digital merchandise store. 🎉

We are proud to launch the brand new Head of the River webshop today! From now on, you can easily and quickly order all your favorite items — just from your couch, on the go, or between training sessions.   

In the webshop, you will find a carefully selected range of clothing and accessories, all in the style of the Head of the River. Whether you are looking for something practical for on the water, a nice item to give as a gift, or just something to show your love for rowing: you will find it all here.   

With the launch of this webshop, we are taking a big step forward. It will be easier to connect our community, make merchandise accessible, and make our event even more visible — both on the water and online.  

Take a look quickly in **[the webshop](https://shop.headoftheriver.nl)** and be surprised.    
Happy shopping! 🚣‍♂️🛒
