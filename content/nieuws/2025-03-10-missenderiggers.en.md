During the night of March 7th to 8th, riggers were stolen from the boat trailers of A.U.S.R. Orca and R.V. Nautilus. An unknown party took a large number of parts, most of which were in rigging covers from the brands Filippi and Swift (among others).

Both associations are urgently appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard something. Information can be shared with Roos Demmers, the Competition Rowing Commissioner of A.U.S.R. Orca, and Eveline Wouters, the Competition Rowing Commissioner of R.V. Nautilus.

Furthermore, Orca is asking for assistance in the form of extra riggers and/or boats that can be borrowed for the upcoming Heineken Roeivierkamp and possibly for a longer period. Anyone willing to help is requested to contact the mentioned persons.
