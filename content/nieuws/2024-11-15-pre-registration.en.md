On March 8 and 9, 2025, the international long-distance rowing classic, Head of the River Amstel, will take place once again in Amsterdam. We would like to invite you to participate (or participate again) in a coxed four or an eight in one of the oldest and largest long-distance rowing races in the Netherlands.

The Head of the River Amstel offers events in multiple categories for rowers of all ages:   
- Pre-master category: Young rowers (22-32 years old) from different clubs can compete together in this category.
- Classic age group categories: Men and women have their own categories, but there are also opportunities to race in mixed teams. You can compete in mixed eights or mixed quads, with a 50% male-female composition.
- Mixed crews in men's boats: One or more women in a Master men's boat? That's possible! Results will count in the men's category, with no correction factor.
- Double eights: This event is growing in popularity for both men and women.
- Coastal Endurance: As introduced last year, the spectacular Coastal Endurance category will again be part of the race schedule.

Registration for the Head of the River Amstel will open on February 1, 2025, via the [KNRB website](https://mijnvereniging.knrb.nl). For international crews, we offer the opportunity to pre-register. By completing the [form](../../deelnemers/inschrijving/) on the website, you will secure your entry into the race (final registration will follow on [mijnvereniging.knrb.nl](https://mijnvereniging.knrb.nl)).

By the end of November or early December, the event categories and block schedule will be published on the Head of the River Amstel website.
