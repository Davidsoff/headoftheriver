On March 8 and 9, 2025, the famous Head of the River Amstel took place: an exciting eight-kilometer rowing race over the Amstel in Amsterdam. About 4000 rowers competed in this national long-distance championship, and it was a spectacle from start to finish!

With more than 500 entries from home and abroad, it was a top competition for both the rowers and the enthusiastic fans. The beautiful weather ensured full stands on the peninsula at Willem 3, where the audience loudly cheered on the participants for two days.

View the photo impression and the summary video of this fantastic race [here](../../../over/media/)!

Thanks to all participants, visitors, ARB, Willem III, and more than 150 enthusiastic volunteers who made this great edition possible. We can't wait for next year already!
