The Head of the River is not only about rowing, but also about enjoying good food and drinks together. 🍽️🍷
We are excited to announce that we will be hosting a special dinner on Friday evening, March 6st, 2026, to kick off the event in style. This will be a fantastic opportunity for rowers, coaches, volunteers, and supporters to come together, share stories, and enjoy a delicious meal before the big day on the water.

The dinner will be held at Rowing club Willem 3, located at the Jan Vroegopsingel 8 in Amsterdam. We will be serving a 2 course meal. The cost of the dinner is €15 per person.

Use our [special Webshop page](https://shop.headoftheriver.nl/product/diner-vrijdagavond-6-maart/) to sign up for the dinner and secure your spot. We look forward to seeing you there and sharing a wonderful evening together! 🚣‍♂️🍽️🎉
