March 9 and 10, 2024, the long distance classic 'Head of the River Amstel' will be rowed in Amsterdam. 

If you would like to participate (again) in a four or an eight in one of the oldest and biggest long-distance rowing races in the Netherlands, please check the website for the [category and block schedule](../../deelnemers/tijdschema/).

The Head has a category for all ages. Young rowers (22-32 years old) from different clubs can compete in the Pre-master category. In addition to the classic women and men categories, it is also possible to row in mixed teams, in a mixed eight and mixed quads. The male-female ratio in mixed boats must be 50%.

One or more women in a Masters men's boat? That is also possible. The results count in the men category; there is no correction factor. The double eight is also gaining popularity for both women and men. And like last year, the spectacular Coastal Endurance category has been added to the time schedule.

Registration for the Head of the River Amstel will start on February 1st, 2024.  Please check the [Entries](../../deelnemers/inschrijving/) page to see how you can register and keep an eye on the website for the most recent information.

We are looking forward to seeing you in Amsterdam!
