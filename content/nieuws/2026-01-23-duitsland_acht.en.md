The organization is very pleased to announce that Mark Emke, head coach of the German national men’s eight, has confirmed that Team Deutschland-Achter will participate in the Head of the River with two eights. Their participation underscores the international character and sporting level of the event. The German crews belong to the top tier of world rowing and have a long tradition of strong performances at both European and World Championships.    

According to the German Rowing Federation, the plans for the 2026 season are now finalized, with one of the highlights being the competitions in Amsterdam. The team is currently training intensively on their base fitness and race preparation at their training center in Dortmund.    

Starting 20 January, the squad will spend three weeks at a training camp in Portugal (Lago Azul), working on their physical and technical foundation. After that, several national and international regattas are on the calendar, including:

- Performance assessment and long-distance races in Leipzig at the end of March
- German small-boat championships in April
- World Cups in Seville and Lucerne
- European Championships and World Championships, with the World Championships later in the year taking place in Amsterdam — a key milestone on the road to the 2028 Olympic Games

The presence of the German eights at the Head of the River Amstel fits well within this broader seasonal planning and provides both the German team and Dutch rowers with a valuable racing opportunity in preparation for top-level competitions.    

##### Reaction from the organization
The organizing clubs ARB and Willem III are particularly pleased with this confirmation. They see it as an incentive for Dutch club crews and TeamNL to participate in this classic rowing race and take on strong international opponents. The organization hopes this will serve as an extra source of motivation for rowers aiming for international experience and competitive challenge in the run-up to the high season.
