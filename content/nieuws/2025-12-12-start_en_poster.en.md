The Head of the River 2026 is coming! 🚣‍♂️✨

Although March is still a little while away, preparations by both the organization and the crews are already in full swing. The Committee, volunteers, rowers and coxes – everyone is working hard behind the scenes toward an unforgettable edition.

And… tada! Today we proudly present the [poster for 2026](/images/nieuws/2026/Post_poster.jpg)! 🎉   
With this fresh look ahead, we officially open the run-up to the most beautiful long-distance classic of the spring.

Mark March 7–8, 2026 in your calendar — the anticipation has begun! 💙🚣‍♀️
