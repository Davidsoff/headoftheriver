While the Netherlands is gripped by wintry weather, Willem III is in full preparation for the Head of the River Amstel, one of the most prestigious rowing races of the year.
Recently, a new Eight was officially christened by the chairman of the Head Committee, André Mulder. A special moment that marks the starting signal toward the race on the Amstel on 7 & 8 March 2026. ⚓
