We look back on a wonderful Head of the River Amstel, March 11-12, 2023

The skies looked to be stormy, but the weather gods favored us. Saturday brought us the beautiful spring sun and Sunday the wind stayed low. This to the disappointment of the coastal rowers, who participated in the Head for the first time. Two beautiful rowing days with more than four thousand enthusiastic rowers and coxswains, and more than one hundred and twenty satisfied volunteers.

We look forward to greeting everyone again next year at the Amstel.

We thank all volunteers - umpires, the jury, timekeepers, motorboat crews, catering, pontoon managers, info desk and numbers, first aid providers, boat guides, parking attendants, and course crew for their efforts, time, and cheer. We hope to count on you again next year.

We thank our suppliers for the pleasant cooperation and the residents along the track for their leniency.

Thanks also to the rowing clubs along the Amstel for the receiving all the boats and rowers with a special thanks to R.V Willem III and Sk√∏ll for providing rooms and staff.

And finally, thanks to the organizing associations, the Amsterdamsche Roeibond and R.V. Willem III for their support and confidence.


Until next year,

**The Organisation of the Head of the River Amstel**
