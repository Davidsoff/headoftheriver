🚣‍♂️ **Last Call: Join Us as a Volunteer at the Head of the River!** 🚣‍♀️   

On 7 and 8 March 2026, the beautiful Head of the River Amstel will take place once again — one of the largest and most historic rowing races in the Netherlands.   

To ensure the event runs smoothly and safely, we are still looking for a number of enthusiastic volunteers.    
👉 Do you have a few hours to spare?   
👉 Want to contribute to a unique day full of energy and team spirit?   
👉 And would you enjoy being part of a large, friendly volunteer team?   

**Then we’re looking for you!**   

Sign up now and help out as a course builder, timekeeper, catering assistant, or in one of the many other roles.   

Together, we’ll make sure every participant can enjoy a fantastic race.   

🔗 **You can sign up via: [**Volunteers**](../../over/vrijwilligers/)**   

Thank you in advance, and see you along the Amstel! 💙
